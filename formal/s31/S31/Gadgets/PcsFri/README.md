# PCS/FRI proof boundary

The Lean files in this directory establish small parts of the native PCS/FRI
argument. They are imported by `S31.Gadgets`, so normal builds and axiom
audits include their theorems.

## One lifted Merkle opening by hand

Suppose a two-level tree authenticates an opened row `R` at leaf index `1`.
Let `L = leafHash(R)` and let its two siblings, from the leaf upward, be
`S₀` and `S₁`. The verifier computes:

```text
position = 1       (odd):   P = parentHash(S₀, L)
position = 1 / 2 = 0 (even): root = parentHash(P, S₁)
```

[`MerkleOpening.lean`](MerkleOpening.lean) expresses this as `pathRoot` and
records the two actual compression inputs with `pathInputs`. Its theorem
`conflicting_openings_produce_collision` says that if a different row `R'`
is also accepted at the **same root and leaf index**, with a path of the same
height, then one of these concrete events must occur:

1. `R ≠ R'` but `leafHash(R) = leafHash(R')`; or
2. two different ordered child pairs from the compared paths have the same
   `parentHash` output.

No global injectivity assumption is made. A finite cryptographic hash cannot
be globally injective on every possible input. The theorem produces a
collision witness on the compared openings, which is the form needed for a
cryptographic reduction.

For a lifted tree, the row at index `q` contains one value from each column.
`projectedPosition` models the native index map. For a raw query on a
`2^k` domain and a column on a smaller `2^l` domain, it uses

```text
q_l = 2 * floor(q / 2^(k-l+1)) + (q mod 2).
```

For `k=5`, `l=3`, `q=7`, this selects column index `1`. The low bit keeps
the conjugate-circle half. `projectedRow` gathers these values in an agreed
column order. `accepted_row_refines_projected_commitment` says an accepted
opening of this committed row and an accepted opening of a different native
row under the same root and index produce one of the witnessed collisions.

The pinned native test in `deps/stwo-zig/src/core/vcs_lifted/verifier.zig`
replays a captured two-level path to its root and checks rejection after
changing the row, sibling or queried index under that same root. The native
projection test in `deps/stwo-zig/src/core/pcs/utils.zig` checks the
smaller- and larger-domain mappings against canonical circle-group indices.

## What remains to join

The Lean model starts with a full path and a committed projected row. It does
not establish that the Zig multiproof decoder returns precisely that path or
that the tree was built from precisely those columns in that order. It does
not prove BLAKE2s collision resistance, Fiat–Shamir sampling, FRI fold
correctness, low-degree proximity, or a whole-proof security bound. See the
[published-bound audit](../../../../../design/s31/security/PCS_FRI_PUBLISHED_BOUND_AUDIT.md)
for the parameter and reduction gaps.
