# Sealed packages

`context.py` owns repository paths, source hashes, the compiler fingerprint,
source lowering and public ABI metadata. The fingerprint includes the CLI,
every Python implementation file in this directory, the language, library and
inspection modules, the Zig sources, pinned AIR assets, the pinned engine
commit and the Zig version.

`build.py` compiles a JSON relation or `.s31` source into a staging directory.
It checks the compiler and source identities before atomically installing a
package. A text package also contains the original source, its normalized
relation, source map, typed interface and standard-library lock.

`verify.py` checks the manifest, artifact hashes, source-to-relation lowering,
library lock, verification keys, AIR identifiers and profile-specific recursive
keys before package data is used by the CLI. This is **package integrity**, not
a proof check: the installed native verifier checks a proof and public claim.

The public Python API remains in `../s31.py`; its functions import these
modules. The dependency direction is `context -> verify -> build -> CLI`.
